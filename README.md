# PokedexProject
A "Pokedex" where the user can enter a pokemon's name and some information would pop up.

This project was made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS

Features:
Upon launch a search bar where the user can type in a Pokemon of their choosing, then the user clicks the search button.

Upon successful search of a pokemon the sprite of the pokemon appears along with some information about the pokemon

Towards the bottom of the page there's a button that says "Noise" upon clicking it, it will play the pokemon's cry that was selected.

If a pokemon is entered that doesn't exist, then an error message will pop up and the user can try again.

Features to work on:
Evolution level - If the pokemon entered can be evolved, it will show what level that pokemon will evolve at (E.g. Squirtle will evolve at level 16 to Wartortle, Wartortle evolves at level 36 to Blastoise)
